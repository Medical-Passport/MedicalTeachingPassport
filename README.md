# About

This is a web-application for medical professionals to log activities designed to improve their clinical teaching skills. This is so that supervisors can see when people have completed certain activities that they want them to complete by the certain deadline they should complete them. We will include the date they complete these activities and each of the activities. This project is for UChicago medicine to turn an excel file into a function tool.
